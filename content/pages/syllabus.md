Overview
--------

This course talks about practical applications of the continuum concept for deformation of solids and fluids, emphasizing force balance. Topics include stress tensor, infinitesimal and finite strain, and rotation tensors. Constitutive relations applicable to geological materials, including elastic, viscous, brittle, and plastic deformation are studied along with solutions to classical problems in geodynamics.

You are encouraged to discuss the homework, exams, lecture, or the class in general. Problem sets will be given out approximately weekly.

Prerequisites
